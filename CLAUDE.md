# Mavci AI Development System — system repo

This repo **is** a Claude Code plugin marketplace. It is not an application.
Work here changes how every downstream SaaS project is built, so a mistake
propagates. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` before changing structure.

Governing docs: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (design + rationale),
`docs/NATIVE-CAPABILITIES.md` (what Claude Code verifiably does, with URLs
and version), `docs/ROADMAP.md` (phases, acceptance test, locked formats).

## Locked identifiers — never change these

    owner/repo        mavci-ai-devsystem/mavci-ai-devsystem   (private, User account)
    default branch    main
    marketplace       mavci
    plugin            mavci-core
    state directory   .mavci/
    CI secret         MAVCI_TOKEN   (fine-grained PAT, Contents: read-only)

These are written into every project's committed `.claude/settings.json` and CI
workflow. Changing one means hand-editing every project repo. `check-plugin.mjs`
asserts they agree across manifests. Do not propose renaming them.

The account is a **User**, not an Organization: org-level Actions secrets do not
exist here. Every project repo needs its own `MAVCI_TOKEN`.

## Working discipline

The expensive thing is not reading files — it is putting what you read into the
main session, where it is re-sent on every later turn and dilutes attention.

- **Delegate work whose byproducts are large and whose conclusion is small.**
  Repo-wide greps, audits, reading test/CI output, surveying files to answer a
  question — use `Explore` or a subagent and return the conclusion, not the
  transcript.
- **Keep narrow, targeted edits in the main session.** A subagent starts cold
  and re-gathers context; delegating a two-line fix costs more than it saves.
- **Read the smallest useful slice.** Name the function or line range, not the
  whole file, unless you genuinely need all of it.
- **Reports: plain prose, under ~10 lines, no ASCII tables.** If a report needs
  to be long, write it to a file and give me the path.
- **Say plainly when a discrete task is finished**, so I know it is safe to
  `/clear` before the next one.

This governs work on the system itself. It is not a standard the plugin
enforces on projects, and it never justifies less care in the control plane,
the risk policy, or the checker.

## Invariants — a change that breaks one of these is wrong

1. **Zero npm dependencies** in `plugins/mavci-core/scripts/`. Node ESM only,
   Node 22+. This is what makes the escape hatch (`ARCHITECTURE` §11) a passing
   test rather than a promise. `selftest.yml` runs with Claude Code absent.

   **Node 22 is the API floor, and CI is the authority — not your local Node.**
   Every workflow pins `node-version: '22'`, `config.mjs` sets
   `MIN_NODE_MAJOR = 22`, and `plugins/mavci-core/templates/mavci-verify.yml` runs the cloned
   checker on 22 inside every downstream project. A development machine on a
   newer Node runs a 23+ or 24+ API happily and gives no local signal, and the
   failure then surfaces in a *project's* CI, not this repo's. Before using
   anything recent, check it against Node 22 — do not trust a local pass.

   Raised from 20 on 2026-08-28. Per the official `nodejs/Release`
   `schedule.json`, Node 20 (Iron) ended 2026-04-30 and is unpatched; 22 (Jod)
   runs to 2027-04-30, 24 (Krypton) to 2028-04-30. The cost of moving the floor
   is rewriting the committed workflow in every connected project, which is why
   it was done at zero connected projects rather than after the first
   `/mavci-core:connect`. Node 22 has been in maintenance since 2025-10-21, so the
   next move — to 24 — should happen well before April 2027.
2. **`plugins/mavci-core/agents/*.md` are generated.** Source of truth is
   `agent-defs/*.json` plus `agent-defs/_contract.md`. Never hand-edit a
   generated agent; edit the def and run `build-agents.mjs`. CI fails on drift.
3. **No binary files, no NUL bytes, UTF-8 without BOM, LF endings.** A file that
   shows as "Binary files differ" cannot be reviewed and is silently skipped by
   `grep -r`. Enforced by `check-plugin.mjs`.
4. **A new standard requires a new check.** A class-A change (missing standard)
   without a class-B check (nothing verifies it) is rejected — that is how the
   system decays back into prose. Every check needs `plugins/mavci-core/templates/fixtures/
   <check_id>/{bad,good}/`, asserted in CI.
5. **A failed probe is never reported as a pass.** In `doctor.mjs` and anywhere
   else, "could not check" is WARN or FAIL, never OK. An unchecked control is
   not a working control.
6. **Hooks fail open on timeout and crash** (NATIVE-CAPABILITIES 4.17/4.18).
   Every hook script catches its own errors and blocks; timeouts are covered by
   the completion sentinel, not by hope.
7. **State-file format rules are locked** (`ROADMAP`, "Data-format constraints"):
   `schema_version`, `project_id`, ISO-8601 UTC, closed enums, repo-relative
   POSIX paths, one file per entity, prose in sibling `.md`.

## Release

The version in `plugins/mavci-core/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` **is** the release
action — nothing propagates to any project until it is bumped. `release.yml`
fails a tag that disagrees with it.

    edit → build-agents.mjs if a def changed → bump plugin.json → commit →
    push → tag vX.Y.Z → push tag

Propagation is **manual at both links** and costs one operator visit per
machine per release: `git fetch origin` + `checkout -B main origin/main` in
`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/mavci`, then `claude plugin uninstall
mavci-core@mavci` + `claude plugin install mavci-core@mavci --scope user`,
then restart. `/plugin marketplace update` does not move the clone (4 of 4)
and `claude plugin update` does not move the install (1 of 1) — 6.21, and
`ARCHITECTURE` §2 step 5. No project file is edited.
roll-forward is primary, because ref-pinning inside `extraKnownMarketplaces` is
unverified (6.16).

## Current state

Phase 1 built: `architect`, `builder`, `verifier`; 8+4 checker rules; the five
scripts; hooks; scaffold; CI. Not yet built, per plan: `guardian`, `scribe`,
`/release`, `/retro`, `/research`, five standards packs, nine further rules.

Distribution is **partly proven.** Gate 4's re-run (2026-08-28) settled the
shape of it: the plugin is installed **once per machine** with
`claude plugin install mavci-core@mavci --scope user`, and after that a project's
committed `settings.json` loads it with no per-project install — verified by a
brand-new session in a project carrying only that settings block answering
`/context` with three agents and 32 skills. The state that breaks it is a
**project-scoped** install record with no user-scope anchor: it pins the plugin
to one directory and answers for that directory everywhere else, silently
(6.20). Never `/plugin install` from inside a session — it has no scope
argument. `doctor` FAILs the anchorless state and names the pinned repo.

It also found the defect that mattered. v0.1.2 put the argv array in `command`
in `hooks.json`; Claude Code rejected all eight entries and installed the plugin
with **zero hooks** — no risk guard, no standards gate, no phase gate — cleanly
and silently. Fixed in 0.1.3, along with the three checks that should have
caught it: `claude plugin validate --strict` in CI, strict hooks-schema
validation in `check-plugin.mjs`, and `doctor` proving hook registration from
`control/hook-run.json` instead of inferring it from the scripts behaving.

**The lesson, which generalises past this bug:** `--plugin-dir` does not run the
plugin loader's schema validation (4.22), so local development cannot see this
whole class of fault. Before any release, `claude plugin validate --strict` is
the authority — not our reading of the docs, and not a local run.

0.1.4 completes it: `control/hook-run.json` now carries `schema_version` and
`project_id`, has a schema under `plugins/mavci-core/templates/schemas/`, and is covered by
`state.schema_valid`. `check-schemas.mjs` asserts its closed enum agrees with
`config.mjs`, so the duplicated enum cannot drift.

**Gate 3 PASSED against v0.1.4** (2026-08-28). With `settings.json` alone and no
`/plugin install`, `/reload-plugins` reported *2 plugins · 16 skills · 9 agents ·
8 hooks*, and `/context` listed `mavci-core:mavci-architect`, `-builder`,
`-verifier` plus the three `standards-*` packs. Eight hooks registered — the
0.1.2 defect is closed, and the onboarding protocol's core assumption holds.
(That run happened on a machine with an **empty plugin registry**. It is the one
observation of the anchorless path working, and it is recorded as unspecified
behaviour rather than the supported route — the supported route is the
per-machine `--scope user` install. See 6.20 and its session table.)

0.1.5 fixes the two things that pass revealed, both of which are the same shape:
a value that was written down once, wrongly, and then copied everywhere.

1. **The command namespace was the marketplace name, not the plugin name.**
   Claude Code namespaces plugin components by the **plugin** (6.11), so every
   command is `/mavci-core:<skill>` and every agent is `mavci-core:<agent>`.
   `mavci` is only the marketplace, and appears solely in `enabledPlugins` and
   `/plugin update`. 105 references across docs, skills, agent contracts, hook
   messages and schema descriptions named commands nobody could type. No code
   constructed a name from `MARKETPLACE_NAME` — they were all prose literals,
   which is why nothing caught them. `config.mjs` now exports `COMMAND_PREFIX`
   derived from `PLUGIN_NAME`, and `check-plugin.mjs` sweeps the whole tree for
   the marketplace form and fails on it, with a negative control on both halves
   of the needle.

2. **The marketplace `source` form was wrong, and `doctor` demanded the wrong
   one.** Of the four documented forms only `{"source":"git","url":"https://….git"}`
   resolves. `github` clones over SSH (6.18, known since 0.1.3); `url` fetches a
   remote `marketplace.json` over HTTP and 404s on a `.git` address — and `url`
   is what 0.1.3 and 0.1.4 shipped in `plugins/mavci-core/templates/project.settings.json` *and*
   what `doctor` failed every other form into. A checker that drives every
   project into the broken configuration is worse than no checker. `doctor` now
   fails `github`, `url`, an unsubstituted placeholder, and a `git` form pointing
   anywhere else, and every one of those failures prints the working form.
   `check-doctor.mjs` asserts all four, asserts the good form passes, and asserts
   the template and `doctor` agree — the drift that went unnoticed for two
   releases. NATIVE-CAPABILITIES 6.4 carries the full matrix.

0.1.7 is the Gate 4 re-run's finding, and it is about the **machine**, not the
project. The plugin is installed once per machine with
`claude plugin install mavci-core@mavci --scope user`; after that a project's
committed `settings.json` loads it with no per-project step. Never
`/plugin install` from inside a session: it has no `--scope` argument, so it
records `{"scope":"project","projectPath":"<one directory>"}`, and a pin with no
user-scope anchor behind it is the only answer the resolver has for every other
project on the machine — silently (6.20). Two consequences are now enforced,
because both were invisible:

1. `doctor` reports which record holds the plugin up, **FAILs** the anchorless
   state, names every pinned directory, and prints the scoped uninstall before
   the user-scope install (`plugin uninstall` defaults to `--scope user`, so the
   obvious command leaves the pin in place). A project pin *alongside* the
   anchor is written automatically by Claude Code at session start (6.22) and is
   reported as an OK detail — failing on it would fail on every healthy machine.
2. User scope means the plugin resolves in **every repository on the machine**,
   so all eight hooks run in repos that have nothing to do with Mavci. Seven
   were already silent without `.mavci/project.json`; the SessionStart preflight
   was not, and was reporting into unrelated repositories (6.23).
   `check-hooks-quiet.mjs` asserts all eight, both directions, and counts the
   entries in `hooks.json` so a ninth hook fails the test until it is covered.

Still unproven: version propagation across a bump — the four-command manual
procedure above, end to end, from a pushed tag to a restarted session running
the new code — and hooks actually **firing**: 8 hooks are registered, but no
`control/hook-run.json` receipt has been checked in a connected project yet.
Both are Gate 4, restarting from step 3 in a clean project **against v0.1.7**.
`gate4` and `gate4-verify` are contaminated — an emptied `enabledPlugins` in one,
an auto-recorded project pin and an untracked settings file in the other — and
are not valid starting states.
